**Welcome!**

This will be the first entry for our developer diary!\
The main goal of this diary is two-folded.

1. Hopefully we'll provide some interesting reading for those of you who are interested
2. A diary for "internal" use. We're planning on adding a short entry everytime we commit something to our git repo. That way we can keep track of what we're actually doing while entertaining you.

Now on to the actual development!

We started writing a tool in order to automatically create animations based on spritesheets.

By doing it this way we'll save a lot of manual labour in order to create an animation, add the correct sprite (Yeah, I know that should've one spritesheet with all frames but it was out of our control), and so on.

Sure, there still are some manual additions in order to complete the animations, but the most time consuming parts are already done!

Best regards,

Hinken
